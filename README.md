# MaxAir - Smart Thermostat

### Note: Now at Version 1.80.

The previous version, PiHome, was centered around the creation of zones, this version is more centered around devices.

Version 1.1 introduces the 'Switch' zone category. These zones uses a binary switch sensor to control a zone relay and can be used to perform Home Automation tasks.

Version 1.2 Introduces the ability the control schedules based on local Sunset and Sunrise times. The existing 'Switch' zone category has been refined and the binary switch sensor is now classed the same as the Immersion and Humidity zone types.

The new 'Switch' zone category is used when no sensor or system controller are used, examples are:
* A lamp which switches on and off at set times
* A lamp which switches on a sunset and off at some set time
* A security light which switches on at sunset and off at sunrise on the following day

Version 1.3 Introduces support for MQTT Devices, together with Home Assistant Integration.

Version 1.4 Introduces support for multi-zone HVAC systems, together with 3 timer options - HEAT, COOL and AUTO (switch between HEAT and COOL as required).

Version 1.5 Introduced the use of Pump Relays to control the useage of external pumps.

Version 1.6 Introduces Email Notifications for Sensors when they return values either above of below pre-set limits.

Version 1.61 Introduces Away Scheduling, where a single overriding schedule can be activated by the Away Option.

Version 1.7 Introduces a revised Settings Menu option, to improve performance.

Version 1.71 Introduces an option to display a graph when either a Zone or Standalone Sensor tile is clicked. In the case of a Zone tile, buttons on the popup dialogue allow the selection of eithera 24hour or 1hour period graph display, in the case of a standalone sensor, a 24hour period graph will be displayed. The graph popup has buttons to allow swapping between 1hour and 24hour displays.

Version 1.80 Introduces a revised Home screen, which no longer auto-refreshes. The data and indicator fields on the screen are updated individually once every second. The result is that now any pop-up windows that are opened, will remain displayed until closed by the user. 

## Setup:

* Add Nodes (as per PiHome)
* Create Temperature Measurement devices (with a node and child id)
* Create Relay devices (with a node and child id)
* Create Zones using the temperature measurement and relay devices created previously
* Temperature Measurement devices can be displayed without the need to be allocated to a 'zombie' zone

* The Temperature Measurement and Relay devices can be created from the One Touch menu

* Part of the reason for this version is to support HVAC systems and hence the system can be configured to work in either the existing Boiler or HVAC mode. The mode is selected from settings/system configuration menu
